In the failed builds, Build JAR, Smoke test JAR and Save artifact were skipped, so no JAR was made. Only the evidence CSV was saved.

## The bug

The failing test was `cancellationFreesSeat`: S1 books the only seat, cancels, then S2 tries to book and gets "SOLD OUT".

`cancel()` checked that the student had a booking but never removed them, so the seat stayed taken. I added one line:

```java
event.students.remove(studentId);
```

The other two failing tests (cancellation after reload, and the CLI list) failed for the same reason.

## Final JAR

`java -jar festpass.jar help` prints:

```
FestPass - campus event registration (CI setup by Gautam)
```

JAR SHA-256: 097e7bfa83c654ff686c551d448505a4a30d590fc100e3ffcb9dbf50115f7b7e
